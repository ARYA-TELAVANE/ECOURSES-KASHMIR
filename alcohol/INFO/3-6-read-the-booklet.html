        When consumed by pregnant mothers, alcohol enters the bloodstream, passes through the placenta and enters the
        fetus (unborn child).
        <br><br>
        Alcohol can damage a fetus at any stage of pregnancy, but is most serious in the first few months. There is a
        risk of alcohol-related birth defects including growth deficiencies, facial abnormalities, and damage to the
        brain and nervous system.
        <br><br>
        <h3><b>A Trail Of Tragedy</b></h3><br>
        Alcohol has claimed the lives of many gifted artists, musicians and writers over the past decades. These are
        just a few:
        <br><br>
        <ul>
          <strong>John Bonham (1948–1980):</strong> Excessive alcohol led to the tragic death of Led Zeppelin drummer
          John “Bonzo”
          Bonham, best known for his drum solo on the song “Moby Dick.” He was found dead of asphyxiation from vomit
          after a night of heavy drinking, on his way to rehearsals for an upcoming tour.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <strong>Steve Clark (1960–1991):</strong> Guitarist for Def Leppard. A heavy drinker, he died in his London
          home of a lethal
          combination of alcohol and drugs
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <strong>Michael Clarke (1946–1993):</strong> American musician, drummer for The Byrds. He died of liver
          failure after three decades of heavy alcohol consumption.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <strong>Brian Connolly (1945–1997):</strong> Scottish rock vocalist and lead singer for Sweet. His drinking
          problem caused him to leave the band in 1978; he reunited years later but his drinking had damaged his
          health
          and he died of liver failure in 1997.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <strong>Oliver Reed (1938–1999): </strong> British actor known for his roles in Oliver!, Women in Love, The
          Three Musketeers and Gladiator. He died from a sudden heart attack during a break from filming Gladiator. He
          was heavily intoxicated after 3 bottles of rum, 8 bottles of beer and numerous doubles of whiskey.
        </ul>
