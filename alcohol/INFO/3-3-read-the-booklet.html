        Binge drinking is the practice of consuming large quantities of alcohol in a single session, usually defined as
        five or more drinks at one time for a man, or four or more drinks at one time for a woman.
        <br> <br>
        About 90% of the alcohol consumed by youth under the age of 21 in the United States is in the form of binge
        drinks.
        <br><br>
        <em>“I binge drink every chance I get and to be honest I am disgusted with myself, but I cannot control my
          desire to
          do it.... If I drink too much or drink certain drinks, I get breathless and go blotchy all over my body, but I
          continue to drink until I am so exhausted I fall asleep.... I am not sure that I am strong enough to quit my
          stupidity.”</em>
        <strong>—</strong>
        <strong>Allen</strong>

        <em>“By the time I was in my mid-20s I was locked in to drinking.”</em>
        <em>“By the time I was in my mid-20s I
          was locked in to drinking.”</em>
        <em>“I started to realize that when I didn’t have a drink I had a sense of panic and I would start shaking.

          “If I had to go without a drink, I would go through shakes and sweats. I couldn’t go for more than a few hours
          without a drink.”</em>
        <strong>—</strong>
        <strong>Paul</strong>
        <br><br>
        <em>“This past year I have gone to work drunk, blacked out in clubs and bars and can’t remember getting home.
          Ashamedly I slept with someone and couldn’t even remember the person coming home with me until we bumped into
          each other the next day.”</em>
        <br><br>
        <em>“I’ve destroyed two relationships because I hurt them so much through my drinking, but I put drinking
          first.</em>
        <br><br>
        <em>“My family are so hurt that their daughter is killing herself for apparently no reason.”</em>
