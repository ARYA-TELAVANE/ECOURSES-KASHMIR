                Alcohol dependence (alcoholism) consists of four symptoms:
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Craving:</strong> a strong need, or compulsion, to drink.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Loss of control:</strong> the inability to limit one’s drinking on any given occasion.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Physical dependence:</strong> withdrawal symptoms, such as nausea, sweating, shakiness
                        and anxiety, occur
                        when alcohol use is stopped after a period of heavy drinking.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Serious dependence can lead to life-threatening withdrawal symptoms including convulsions, starting
                    eight to twelve hours after the last drink. The delirium tremens (D.T.’s) begins three to four days
                    later where the person becomes extremely agitated, shakes, hallucinates and loses touch with
                    reality.
                </p>
                An increasingly heavy drinker often says he could stop whenever he chooses—he just never “chooses” to do
                so. Alcoholism is not a destination, but a progression, a long road of deterioration in which life
                continuously worsens.

                <br>
                <em>“When I went to quit drinking, I realized that alcohol had taken to my body in such a way that I
                    couldn’t stop. I would shake like I was going to break, I would start to sweat, I couldn’t think
                    until I had another drink. I couldn’t function without it.</em>
                <br>
                <br>
                <em>“I spent the next 8 years in and out of detox and hospitals, trying to figure out what happened to
                    me, how was it possible I couldn’t quit. It was the worst and longest nightmare.” </em>

                Feeling of warmth, flushed skin, impaired judgment, lack of coordination, slurred speech, memory and
                comprehension loss. Heavy drinking usually results in a “hangover,” headache, nausea, anxiety, weakness,
                shakiness and sometimes vomiting.
                <br><br>

                <h5><b>LONG-TERM EFFECTS:</b></h5><br>

                Tolerance to many of the unpleasant effects of alcohol and a resulting ability to drink more. This leads
                to a deteriorating physical condition that can include liver damage and increases the risk of heart
                disease. A pregnant woman may give birth to a baby with defects that affect the baby’s heart, brain and
                other major organs. A person can become dependent on alcohol. If someone suddenly stops drinking,
                withdrawal symptoms may set in. They range from jumpiness, sleeplessness, sweating and poor appetite to
                convulsions and sometimes death. Alcohol abuse can also lead to violence and conflicts in one’s personal
                relationship
