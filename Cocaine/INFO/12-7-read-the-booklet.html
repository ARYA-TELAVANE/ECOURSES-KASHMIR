        When teens were surveyed to find out why they started using drugs in the first place, 55% replied that it was
        due to pressure from their friends. They wanted to be cool and popular. Dealers know this.
        <br><br>

        They will approach you as a friend and offer to “help you out” with “something to bring you up.” The drug will
        “help you fit in” or “make you cool.”
<br><br>
        Drug dealers, motivated by the profits they make, will say anything to get you to buy their drugs. They will
        tell you that “cocaine will make your life a party.”

        They don’t care if the drugs ruin your life as long as they are getting paid. All they care about is money.
        Former dealers have admitted they saw their buyers as “pawns in a chess game.”

        Get the facts about drugs. Make your own decisions.

          “With coke, you are like a moth stuck on a light. It attracts you more and more and you can’t stop it. It’s not physical. It’s in your head. The more you have it, the more you take it. I have injected it in myself every ten minutes. I borrowed money from the bank to buy it. One day I became unemployed. It was worse. I used to shoot up all the time. This thing made me insane. I knew it, but I continued. I became a total failure.”<b>—Marilyn</b>
