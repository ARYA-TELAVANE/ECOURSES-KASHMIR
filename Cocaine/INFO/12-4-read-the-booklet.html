                <h6><b>What are the short-term effects of cocaine?</b></h6>
                Cocaine causes a short-lived, intense high that is immediately followed by the opposite—intense
                depression, edginess and a craving for more of the drug. People who use it often don’t eat or sleep
                properly. They can experience greatly increased heart rate, muscle spasms and convulsions. The drug can
                make people feel paranoid,1 angry, hostile and anxious—even when they aren’t high.
                <br><br>
                Regardless of how much of the drug is used or how frequently, cocaine increases the risk that the user
                will experience a heart attack, stroke, seizure or respiratory (breathing) failure, any of which can
                result in sudden death.
                <br><br>
                <h6><b>What are the long-term effects of cocaine?</b></h6>
                <br><br>
                The phrase “dope fiend” was originally coined many years ago to describe the negative side effects of
                constant cocaine use. As tolerance to the drug increases, it becomes necessary to take greater and
                greater quantities to get the same high. Prolonged daily use causes sleep deprivation and loss of
                appetite. A person can become psychotic and begin to experience hallucinations.
                <br><br>
                As cocaine interferes with the way the brain processes chemicals, one needs more and more of the drug
                just to feel “normal.” People who become addicted to cocaine (as with most other drugs) lose interest in
                other areas of life.
                <br><br>
                Coming down from the drug causes depression so severe that a person will do almost anything to get the
                drug—even commit murder.
                <br><br>
                And if he or she can’t get cocaine, the depression can get so intense it can drive the addict to
                suicide. <br><br><br>

                    “Don’t touch cocaine. I spent two years in jail because of this drug. And when I got out, life was
                    so hard I started taking the drug again. I know 10 girls who became prostitutes because of coke.
                    It’s much more extreme and degrading than we believe. At the time we don’t realize to what degree it
                    destroys us.”
