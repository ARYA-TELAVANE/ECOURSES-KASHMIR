        One often hears the statement, “Yes, I take drugs, but that’s my business!” But drug use always has its innocent victims, from those who become prey of addicts seeking through desperate means to finance their drug habit, to those who die in traffic accidents caused by drivers under the influence.
<br><br><br>
        The most tragic victims of cocaine are babies born to mothers who use the drug during pregnancy. In the United States alone, tens of thousands of cocaine-exposed babies are born in a year. Those not addicted often suffer from a variety of physical problems which can include premature birth, low birthweight, stunted growth, birth defects and damage to the brain and nervous system.
        <br><br><br>
        Low-birthweight babies are twenty times more likely to die in their first month of life than normal-weight babies, and they face an increased risk of lifelong disabilities such as mental retardation and brain damage.
        
        The impact on society of this human tragedy has yet to be fully measured.

        <b>DANGER NO. 1:</b> By 1995, less than 10% of Ecstasy pills on the market were pure MDMA. Today’s Ecstasy user
        is usually taking a mix of a wide variety of drugs, and often toxic substances.
        <br><br>
        <b>DANGER NO. 2:</b> One has to continually increase the amount of the drug one takes in order to feel the same
        effects. Users say the effect of Ecstasy is greatly reduced after the first dose. And as a person takes more of
        the drug, the negative effects also increase.<br>
        Because the desired effect from using the drug diminishes, a person often then tries other drugs that are even
        more dangerous.
        <br><br>
        <b>DANGER NO.5</b> Users feel there is sometimes a need to use other drugs such as heroin or cocaine to help
        cope with the mental and physical pain that results after one “comes down” from Ecstasy; 92% of those who take
        Ecstasy also abuse other, even harder drugs.
        <br><br>
        <b>DANGER NO. 4:</b> The false idea that a person only feels good with Ecstasy leads to a desire to take it more
        often than just at raves and techno parties; like other stimulant drugs, people continue to take Ecstasy,
        despite experiencing unpleasant effects.

        <i><br><br>
          “I hear a lot of people talking about Ecstasy, calling it a fun, harmless drug. All I can think is, ‘If they only knew.’
          <br><br>

          “In five months, I went from living somewhat responsibly while pursuing my dream to a person who didn’t care about a thing—and the higher I got, the deeper I sank into a dark, lonely place. When I did sleep, I had nightmares and the shakes. I had pasty skin, a throbbing head and the beginnings of feeling paranoid, but ignored it all, thinking it was normal. Until the night I thought I was dying.
          <br><br>
          Ecstasy took my strength, my motivation, my dreams, my friends, my apartment, my money and most of all, my sanity. I worry about my future and my health every day. I have many mountains ahead of me, but I plan to keep climbing because I’m one of the lucky ones.”<b>—Lynn</b>
