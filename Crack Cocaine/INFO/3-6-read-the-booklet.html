    </div>
    When teens were surveyed to find out why they started using drugs in the first place, 55% replied that it was due to
    pressure from their friends. They wanted to be cool and popular. Dealers know this.

        <br>
        They will approach you as a friend and offer to “help you out” with “something to bring you up.” The drug will
        “help you fit in” or “make you cool.”
        <br><br>
        Drug dealers, motivated by the profits they make, will say anything to get you to buy their drugs. They will
        tell you “just try crack once and everything’s gonna be okay; it will make everything go away.”

    They don’t care if the drugs ruin your life as long as they are getting paid. All they care about is money.
    Former dealers have admitted they saw their buyers as “pawns in a chess game.”
    <br><br>
    Get the facts about drugs. Make your own decisions.
