                The most innocent victims of crack cocaine are babies born to mothers who use the drug during pregnancy.
                The March of Dimes, a nonprofit organization for pregnancy and baby health, reports that use of cocaine
                in either powdered or crack form during pregnancy can affect a woman and her unborn baby in many ways.
                During the early months of pregnancy, it may increase the risk of miscarriage. It also may cause an
                unborn baby to have a stroke, permanent brain damage or heart attack.
                <br><br>
                <p>The National Institute for Drug Abuse reports that exposure to crack cocaine during pregnancy may
                    lead to
                    significant later problems in some children.</p>

        <p><em>“I was introduced to smoking crack cocaine, and that is when everything stopped functioning. I was out
                with some people who at that time I considered real close friends. You know, it is true what they say
                about crack: when you take that first hit, that high you will never get again....It ruined me
                completely. It took total control over me.</em></p>
