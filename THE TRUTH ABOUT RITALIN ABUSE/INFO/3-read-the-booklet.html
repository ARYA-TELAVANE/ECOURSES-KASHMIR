            <br>                 

            Ritalin is the common name for methylphenidate, classified by the Drug Enforcement Administration as a Schedule II narcotic—the same classification as cocaine, morphine and amphetamines.1 It is abused by teens for its stimulant effects.             
            <br> <br>
            Even when Ritalin is used as a prescription drug, it may have severe effects including nervousness, insomnia, anorexia, loss of appetite, pulse changes, heart problems and weight loss. The manufacturer says it is a drug of dependency.             
            <br> <br>
            In June 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a series of public health advisories warning that Ritalin and drugs like it may cause visual hallucinations, suicidal thoughts and psychotic behavior, as well as aggression or violent behavior.             
            <br> <br>
            <strong> One writer put it this way:</strong> <q>Parents are never told: ‘Oh, by the way, once in a while a child dies simply by taking their prescribed medication.’ Or ‘By the way, children on stimulant medications have twice the future rate of drug abuse.’ Or ‘By the way, one third of all children on these medications develop symptoms of obsessive-compulsive behavior within the first year.’  </q>

            The most commonly used illegal drug is marijuana. According to the United Nations 2008 World Drug Report, about 3.9% of the world’s population between the ages of 15 and 64 abuse marijuana.

               Young people today are exposed earlier than ever to drugs. Based on a survey by the Centers for Disease Control in 2007, 45% of high school students nationwide <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#209FA6">drank alcohol </span>and 19.7% smoked pot during a one-month period.             
                <br> <br>
               In Europe, recent studies among 15- and 16-year-olds suggest that use of <a href="Marijuana.html"><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#209FA6">marijuana</span></a> varies from under 10% to over 40%, with the highest rates reported by teens in the Czech Republic (44%), followed by Ireland (39%), the UK (38%) and France (38%). In Spain and the United Kingdom, <a href="Cocaine.html"><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#209FA6">cocaine</span></a> use among 15- to 16-year-olds is 4% to 6%. Cocaine use among young people has risen in Denmark, Italy, Spain, UK, Norway and France.  
                <br> <br>
                By the late 1990s, the mortality rate of heroin addicts was estimated to be as high as twenty times greater than the rest of the population.

                <q><em>My goal in life wasn’t living . . . it was getting high. Over the years, I turned to cocaine, marijuana and alcohol under a false belief it would allow me to escape my problems. It just made things worse. I kept saying to myself, I’m going to stop permanently after using one last time. It never happened.</em></q>-<strong>  John </strong>

                <q><em>It started with the weed, then the pills <a href="Ecstasy.html"><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#209FA6">(Ecstasy) and acid</span></a>, making cocktails of all sorts of drugs, even overdosing to make the rushes last longer. I had a bad trip one night . . . I prayed and cried for this feeling to go away, I had voices in my head, had the shakes and couldn’t leave home for six months. I thought everyone was watching me. I couldn’t walk in public places. Man! I couldn’t even drive.</em></q>

                <q><em>I ended up homeless and on the streets, living and sleeping in a cardboard box, begging and struggling to find ways to get my next meal</em></q>-<strong> Ben  </strong>
