            On LSD, which is often taken in tab form, an intense, altered state transforms into disassociation and despair. Often there is no stopping “bad trips,” which can go on for up to twelve hours.

<i>“I started drinking at the age of 15. Then I progressed to taking Ecstasy, speed, cocaine and LSD.
<br><br>
“I found it difficult to hold down a job and became depressed and thought I would never overcome my obsession with drugs. I attempted suicide twice by overdosing on pills. I was put under psychiatrists who gave me even more drugs, antidepressants and tranquilizers, which just made matters worse.
<br><br>
“As an outlet for my feelings I turned to self-harm—I started cutting and burning myself.”</i> —Justin
