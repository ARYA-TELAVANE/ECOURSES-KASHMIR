        The effects of LSD are unpredictable. They depend on the amount taken, the person’s mood and personality, and
        the surroundings in which the drug is used. It is a roll of the dice—a racing, distorted high or a severe,
        paranoid1 low.
        <br><br>
        Normally, the first effects of LSD are experienced thirty to ninety minutes after taking the drug. Often, the
        pupils become dilated. The body temperature can become higher or lower, while the blood pressure and heart rate
        either increase or decrease. Sweating or chills are not uncommon.
        <br><br>
        LSD users often experience loss of appetite, sleeplessness, dry mouth and tremors. Visual changes are among the
        more common effects—the user can become fixated on the intensity of certain colors.
        <br><br>

        Extreme changes in mood, anywhere from a spaced-out “bliss” to intense terror, are also experienced. The worst
        part is that the LSD user is unable to tell which sensations are created by the drug and which are part of
        reality.
        <br><br>
        Some LSD users experience an intense bliss they mistake for “enlightenment.”
        <br><br>
        Not only do they disassociate from their usual activities in life, but they also feel the urge to keep taking
        more of the drug in order to re-experience the same sensation. Others experience severe, terrifying thoughts and
        feelings, fear of losing control, fear of insanity and death, and despair while using LSD. Once it starts, there
        is often no stopping a “bad trip,” which can go on for up to twelve hours. In fact, some people never recover
        from an acid-induced psychosis.

        Taken in a large enough dose, LSD produces delusions and visual hallucinations. The user’s sense of time and
        self changes. Sizes and shapes of objects become distorted, as do movements, colors and sounds. Even one’s sense
        of touch and the normal bodily sensations turn into something strange and bizarre. Sensations may seem to “cross
        over,” giving the user the feeling of hearing colors and seeing sounds. These changes can be frightening and can
        cause panic.
        <br><br>
        The ability to make sensible judgments and see common dangers is impaired. An LSD user might try to step out a
        window to get a “closer look” at the ground. He might consider it fun to admire the sunset, blissfully unaware
        that he is standing in the middle of a busy intersection.
        <br><br>
        Many LSD users experience flashbacks, or a recurrence of the LSD trip, often without warning, long after taking
        LSD.
        <br><br>
        Bad trips and flashbacks are only part of the risks of LSD use. LSD users may manifest relatively long-lasting
        psychoses or severe depression.
        <br><br>
        Because LSD accumulates in the body, users develop a tolerance for the drug. In other words, some repeat users
        have to take it in increasingly higher doses to achieve a “high.” This increases the physical effects and also
        the risk of a bad trip that could cause psychosis.

        <i>“At 13 years of age I took my first drink and soon after was introduced to marijuana. Then LSD quickly fell into my hands and I became addicted, eating it like candy.
          <br><br>
          “One night during one of my binges I blacked out and awoke with blood all over my face and vomit coming out of my mouth. By some miracle I pulled myself awake and cleaned myself up. I got into the car, shaking, drove to my parent’s house. I climbed into bed with my mom and cried.
          <br><br>
