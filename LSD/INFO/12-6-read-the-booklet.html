        When teens were surveyed to find out why they started using drugs in the first place, 55% replied that it was
        due to pressure from their friends. They wanted to be cool and popular. Dealers know this.

        Drug dealers, motivated by the profits they make, will say anything to get you to buy their drugs. They will tell you that taking LSD will “expand your mind.”
        <br><br>
        They don’t care if the drugs ruin your life as long as they are getting paid. All they care about is money. Former dealers have admitted they saw their buyers as “pawns in a chess game.”

        A study released in January 2008 found that about 3.1 million people in the US aged 12 to 25 said they had used
        LSD.

          “Within my own little trip world I started to get paranoid, feeling my friends were conspiring to do something, maybe even kill me. I thought to myself, I have to get out of here.
          <br><br>

          “I ran into my friend’s bedroom, opened the window as wide as it would go and jumped out. Luckily for me my friend lived on the ground floor. I ran across a wooded area toward a bridge. I could feel my heart starting to beat faster and faster. I heard voices telling me I was going to have a heart attack and die.
          <br><br>
          “This was not the end. Years later, I was running and all of a sudden, bam, I was having flashbacks of the time I was running in my trip. I started to have a bad panic attack and heard voices telling me I was going to have a heart attack and die.
          <br><br>
          “I would tell anyone even thinking of taking LSD to reconsider.” <b>—Brain</b>
