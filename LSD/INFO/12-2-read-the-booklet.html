        </div>
        <p>
            Hallucinogens are drugs that cause hallucinations. Users see images, hear sounds and feel sensations that
            seem very real but do not exist. Some hallucinogens also produce sudden and unpredictable changes in the
            mood of those who use them.

        <p>
            <i>“At the age of 16 I was introduced to a drug that I abused for over three years—LSD. What I was unaware
                of was the fact that LSD is the most potent hallucinogen known to man.
                <br><br>

                “The drug came on a small piece of paper no bigger than my index finger, called a blotter. Fifteen
                minutes after putting the paper on my tongue my entire body got hot and I began to sweat.
                <br><br>

                “Some other reactions that I experienced while on the drug included dilated pupils, nausea and ‘goose
                bumps.’ While high on LSD I felt like there was a huge distortion both in my mind and body. The visual
                changes as well as the extreme changes in mood were like some strange scary trip—one in which I felt
                like I had no control over my mind and body.” <b>—Edith</b></i>
