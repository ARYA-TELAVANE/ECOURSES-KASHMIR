                Albert Hofmann, a chemist working for Sandoz Pharmaceutical, synthesized1 LSD for the first time in
                1938, in Basel, Switzerland, while looking for a blood stimulant. However, its hallucinogenic effects
                were unknown until 1943 when Hofmann accidentally consumed some LSD. It was later found that an oral
                dose of as little as 25 micrograms (equal in weight to a few grains of salt) is capable of producing
                vivid hallucinations.
                <br><br>
                Because of its similarity to a chemical present in the brain and its similarity in effects to certain
                aspects of psychosis, LSD was used in experiments by psychiatrists through the 1940s, ’50s and ’60s.
                While the researchers failed to discover any medical use for the drug, the free samples supplied by
                Sandoz Pharmaceuticals for the experiments were distributed broadly, leading to wide use of this
                substance.
                It is almost impossible to grow up in America, or any country, and not be exposed to drugs. Peer
                pressure to do drugs is high and honest information about the dangers of drugs is not always available.
                <br><br>
                LSD was popularized in the 1960s by individuals such as psychologist Timothy Leary, who encouraged
                American students to “turn on, tune in, and drop out.” This created an entire counterculture of drug
                abuse and spread the drug from America to the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe. Even today, use of
                LSD in the United Kingdom is significantly higher than in other parts of the world.


                <br><br>
                While the ‘60s counterculture used the drug to escape the problems of society, the Western intelligence
                community and the military saw it as a potential chemical weapon. In 1951, these organizations began a
                series of experiments. US researchers noted that LSD “is capable of rendering whole groups of people,
                including military forces, indifferent to their surroundings and situations, interfering with planning
                and judgment, and even creating apprehension, uncontrollable confusion and terror.”
                <br><br>
                Experiments in the possible use of LSD to change the personalities of intelligence targets, and to
                control whole populations, continued until the United States officially banned the drug in 1967.
                <br><br>
                <q><em>“The days following my LSD use, I was filled with anxiety and extreme depression. Following my first ‘trip’ on LSD, I would eat it frequently, sometimes up to four or five times per week for an extended period. Each time I would take the drug, mentally I was drifting more and more out of reality. The eventual effect was the inability to feel normal in my own skin.” </em></q>
