                In Europe, as many as 4.2% of those aged 15 to 24 have taken LSD at least once. When surveyed, the
                percentage of people in this age group who had used LSD in the past year exceeded 1% in seven countries
                (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Italy, Latvia, Hungary and Poland).

                In America, since 1975, researchers funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse have annually
                surveyed nearly 17,000 high school seniors nationwide to determine trends in drug use and to measure the
                students’ attitudes and beliefs about drug abuse. Between 1975 and 1997, the lowest period of LSD use
                was reported by the class of 1986, when 7.2% of high school seniors reported using LSD at least once in
                their lives.

                The percentage of seniors reporting LSD use at least once over the course of the prior year nearly
                doubled from a low of 4.4% in 1985 to 8.4% in 1997. In 1997, 13.6% of seniors had experimented with LSD
                at least once in their lives.

                A study released in January 2008 found that about 3.1 million people in the US aged 12 to 25 said they
                had used LSD.
