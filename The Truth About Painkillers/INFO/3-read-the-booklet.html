            <br>                 

            While the use of many street drugs is on a slight decline in the US, abuse of prescription drugs is growing. In 2007, 2.5 million Americans abused prescription drugs for the first time, compared to 2.1 million who used marijuana for the first time.            
            <br> <br>
            Among teens, prescription drugs are the most commonly used drugs next to marijuana, and almost half of the teens abusing prescription drugs are taking painkillers.
            <br> <br>
            Why are so many young people turning to prescription drugs to get high?
            <br> <br>
            By survey, almost 50% of teens believe that taking prescription drugs is much safer than using illegal street drugs.
            <br><br>
            What is not known by most of these young people is the risk they are taking by consuming these highly potent and mind-altering drugs. Long-term use of painkillers can lead to dependence, even for people who are prescribed them to relieve a medical condition but eventually fall into the trap of abuse and addiction.
            <br><br>
            In some cases, the dangers of painkillers don’t surface until it is too late. In 2007, for example, abuse of the painkiller Fentanyl killed more than 1,000 people. The drug was found to be thirty to fifty times more powerful than heroin.

            The most commonly used illegal drug is marijuana. According to the United Nations 2008 World Drug Report, about 3.9% of the world’s population between the ages of 15 and 64 abuse marijuana.

               Young people today are exposed earlier than ever to drugs. Based on a survey by the Centers for Disease Control in 2007, 45% of high school students nationwide <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#209FA6">drank alcohol </span>and 19.7% smoked pot during a one-month period.             
                <br> <br>
               In Europe, recent studies among 15- and 16-year-olds suggest that use of <a href="Marijuana.html"><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#209FA6">marijuana</span></a> varies from under 10% to over 40%, with the highest rates reported by teens in the Czech Republic (44%), followed by Ireland (39%), the UK (38%) and France (38%). In Spain and the United Kingdom, <a href="Cocaine.html"><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#209FA6">cocaine</span></a> use among 15- to 16-year-olds is 4% to 6%. Cocaine use among young people has risen in Denmark, Italy, Spain, UK, Norway and France.  
                <br> <br>
                By the late 1990s, the mortality rate of heroin addicts was estimated to be as high as twenty times greater than the rest of the population.

                <q><em>My goal in life wasn’t living . . . it was getting high. Over the years, I turned to cocaine, marijuana and alcohol under a false belief it would allow me to escape my problems. It just made things worse. I kept saying to myself, I’m going to stop permanently after using one last time. It never happened.</em></q>-<strong>  John </strong>

                <q><em>It started with the weed, then the pills <a href="Ecstasy.html"><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#209FA6">(Ecstasy) and acid</span></a>, making cocktails of all sorts of drugs, even overdosing to make the rushes last longer. I had a bad trip one night . . . I prayed and cried for this feeling to go away, I had voices in my head, had the shakes and couldn’t leave home for six months. I thought everyone was watching me. I couldn’t walk in public places. Man! I couldn’t even drive.</em></q>
