        <b>1) The Rush—</b> A rush is the initial response the abuser feels when smoking or injecting methamphetamine.
        During the rush, the abuser’s heartbeat races and metabolism,1 blood pressure and pulse soar. Unlike the rush
        associated with crack cocaine, which lasts for approximately two to five minutes, the methamphetamine rush can
        continue for up to thirty minutes.
        <br><br>
        <b>2) The High—</b> The rush is followed by a high, sometimes called “the shoulder.” During the high, the abuser
        often feels aggressively smarter and becomes argumentative, often interrupting other people and finishing their
        sentences. The delusional effects can result in a user becoming intensely focused on an insignificant item, such
        as repeatedly cleaning the same window for several hours. The high can last four to sixteen hours.
        <br><br>
        <b>3) The Binge—</b> A binge is uncontrolled use of a drug or alcohol. It refers to the abuser’s urge to
        maintain the high by smoking or injecting more methamphetamine. The binge can last three to fifteen days. During
        the binge, the abuser becomes hyperactive both mentally and physically. Each time the abuser smokes or injects
        more of the drug, he experiences another but smaller rush until, finally, there is no rush and no high.
        <br><br>

        <b>4) Tweaking—</b> A methamphetamine abuser is most dangerous when experiencing a phase of the addiction called
        “tweaking”—a condition reached at the end of a drug binge when methamphetamine no longer provides a rush or a
        high. Unable to relieve the horrible feelings of emptiness and craving, an abuser loses his sense of identity.
        Intense itching is common and a user can become convinced that bugs are crawling under his skin. Unable to sleep
        for days at a time, the abuser is often in a completely psychotic state and he exists in his own world, seeing
        and hearing things that no one else can perceive. His hallucinations are so vivid that they seem real and,
        disconnected from reality, he can become hostile and dangerous to himself and others. The potential for
        self-mutilation is high.
        <br><br>
        <b>5) The Crash—</b> To a binge abuser, the crash happens when the body shuts down, unable to cope with the drug
        effects overwhelming it; this results in a long period of sleep for the person. Even the meanest, most violent
        abuser becomes almost lifeless during the crash. The crash can last one to three days.
        <br><br>
        <b>6) Meth Hangover—</b> After the crash, the abuser returns in a deteriorated state, starved, dehydrated and
        utterly exhausted physically, mentally and emotionally. This stage ordinarily lasts from two to fourteen days.
        This leads to enforced addiction, as the “solution” to these feelings is to take more meth.
        <br><br>
        <b>7) Withdrawal—</b> Often thirty to ninety days can pass after the last drug use before the abuser realizes
        that he is in withdrawal. First, he becomes depressed, loses his energy and the ability to experience pleasure.
        Then the craving for more methamphetamine hits, and the abuser often becomes suicidal. Since meth withdrawal is
        extremely painful and difficult, most abusers revert; thus, 93% of those in traditional treatment return to
        abusing methamphetamine.
