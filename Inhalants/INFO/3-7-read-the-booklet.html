                Inhalants can be physically and psychologically addictive. Users report a strong urge to continue using
                inhalants, especially after continued usage over many days.
                <br><br>
                Habitual users coming off inhalants suffer withdrawal symptoms which can include nausea, excessive
                sweating, muscle cramps, headaches, chills, agitation, with shaking and hallucinations. In severe cases,
                withdrawal can cause convulsions.
                <br><br>
                The vast majority of cocaine users (90%) began by first using a drug like marijuana, cigarettes or
                alcohol. Of course, not everyone who smokes marijuana and hashish goes on to use harder drugs. Some
                never do. Others quit using marijuana altogether. But some do. One study found that youth (12 to 17
                years old) who use marijuana are 85 times more likely to use cocaine than kids who do not use weed, and
                that 60% of the kids who smoke weed before the age of 15 move on to cocaine.

His senseless death rocked the worlds of all who knew him. Justin was an honors student who loved life and embraced it with enthusiasm. . . . He was a source of inspiration for many. . . . I will always be haunted by the question of whether Justin would be with us today had he known about the risks he was taking.” </em></q>
