                    <li> Inhalants starve the body of oxygen and force the heart to beat irregularly and more rapidly.
                    </li>
                    <li>Users can experience nausea and nosebleeds and lose their sense of hearing or smell. Chronic use
                        can lead to muscle wasting and reduced muscle tone, and the poisonous chemicals gradually damage
                        the lungs and the immune system</li>
                    <li>An inhalant user risks Sudden Sniffing Death Syndrome. Death can occur the first time or the
                        hundredth time an inhalant is used.</li>

                By the early 1980s, MDMA was being promoted as “the hottest thing in the continuing search for happiness
                through chemistry,” and the “in drug” for many weekend parties. Still legal in 1984, MDMA was being sold
                under the brand name “Ecstasy,” but by 1985, the drug had been banned due to safety concerns.
                <br><br>

                Since the late 1980s, Ecstasy has become an embracive “marketing” term for drug dealers selling
                “Ecstasy-type” drugs that may, in fact, contain very little or no MDMA at all. And while MDMA itself can
                produce harmful effects, what is called Ecstasy today can contain a wide mixture of substances—from LSD,
                cocaine, heroin, amphetamine and methamphetamine, to rat poison, caffeine, dog deworming substances,
                etc.<br> Despite the cute logos dealers put on the pills, this is what makes Ecstasy particularly
                dangerous; a user never really knows what he is taking. The dangers are increased when users increase
                the dose seeking a previous high, not knowing they may be taking an entirely different combination of
                drugs.
                <br><br>
                Ecstasy most commonly comes in pill form but can also be injected and taken in other ways. Liquid
                Ecstasy is actually GHB, a nervous system depressant—a substance that can also be found in drain
                cleaner, floor stripper and degreasing solvents.<br><br><br>

            <i>“It was a steady progression from glue sniffing, gas sniffing, magic mushrooms, that went on until I was
                17. Then I started on cannabis. I was spending my money on as much cannabis as I could get my hands on.
                Then I was old enough to go into the clubs, so I started there on amphetamines and Ecstasy....<br><br>

                “I began hanging out with people who were taking heroin, and soon I was using it more and more until I
                was addicted. I had no idea then the damage it would cause me later...that I would be serving one prison
                sentence after another, burglarizing people’s houses, stealing from my family. All the pain and
                heartache that I have caused was worse than stealing the material things from them.” <b>—Dennis</b><br><br>

                “When I was in fourth grade a so-called friend of mine introduced me to inhalants. Being so young and
                not knowing any better, I started huffing gas every day all the way up to my eighth grade year. My motor
                function skills are pretty much shot and I sit for hours on end just staring into space without a single
                thought even crossing my mind. It’s like my body is here but I am not. I have a hard time holding down
                jobs and I have been living by myself now for twelve years. <br>I look normal from the outside but when I
                try to show interest and talk to women, it becomes apparent that I am pretty much a vegetable. I am sick
                of living this way and I would rather be dead than to live my life like this anymore, because it seems
                like I’m already dead anyway.” <b>—John</b>
