        <!-- <ul>
          <li>According to the 2007 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, an estimated 12.4 million Americans aged 12 or older tried Ecstasy at least once in their lives, representing 5% of the US population in that age group.</li>
          <li>Results of the 2007 survey indicated that 2.3% of eighth graders, 5.2% of tenth graders and 6.5% of twelfth graders had tried Ecstasy at least once.</li>
          <li>92% of those who begin using Ecstasy later turn to other drugs including marijuana, amphetamines, cocaine and heroin.</li>
        </ul> -->
        <br> <br>
        The inhaling of fumes from chemicals such as incense, oils, resins, spices and perfumes to alter consciousness,
        or as part of religious ceremonies, dates back to ancient times in Egypt, Babylonia (present-day Iraq), India
        and China.
        <br><br>
        According to some researchers, inhaling gas vapors to alter one’s state of consciousness was practiced by
        priestesses at the Oracle of Delphi1 in ancient Greece.
        <br>
        In the early 1800s, nitrous oxide, ether and chloroform were the anesthetics used commonly as intoxicants.
        <br><br>
        Nitrous oxide was regarded as a cheap substitute for alcohol and was popularized by the British scientist Sir
        Humphry Davy. He held nitrous oxide parties and coined the word “laughing gas” in 1799. Noting the anesthetic
        effects, Davy proposed that the gas could be used for operations, although this was not tried for another half
        century.
        <br><br>The use of anesthetics for recreational purposes continued throughout the nineteenth century in Europe
        and the US.
        <br><br>
        Ether was used as a recreational drug during the 1920s Prohibition era, when alcohol was made illegal in the US.
        In the 1940s, recreational use of solvents, primarily gasoline, became popular.
        <br><br>
        By the 1960s, the practice of solvent sniffing had spread across a wide variety of commercial products including
        paint and lacquer thinners, nail polish remover, shoe polish, lighter fluid, spray paint and others.
        <br><br>

        In more recent years, glue and gas sniffing has become a widespread problem among homeless street children in
        South Asia, Mexico, Eastern Europe, Kenya and other areas around the world. Street kids use these inhalants to
        numb the pain of hunger, cold and desperation.

        Gas and spray paint sniffing is also common in remote regions in Canada, America, Australia, New Zealand and
        some Pacific Islands.

        <h3>IMAGINARY LOVE PILL OFF WITH THE MASK</h3>
        <br><br>
        Ecstasy is often called “the love pill” because it heightens perceptions of color and sound and supposedly amplifies sensations when one touches or caresses another, particularly during sex.
        <br> <br>
        But Ecstasy often contains hallucinogens, which are drugs that act on the mind and cause people to see or feel things that are not really there. Hallucinogens can throw a person into a scary or sad experience from the past, where he or she gets stuck without even realizing it.
        <br>
        The image of Ecstasy as a “love pill” is one of many lies that are spread about the drug.
        <br><br>
        Ecstasy is emotionally damaging and users often suffer depression, confusion, severe anxiety, paranoia,1 psychotic behavior and other psychological problems.
        <br><br>
        <i>“Rave parties are okay so long as you don’t take Ecstasy. But as soon as you start, you think people who advise you to stop are idiots. You start to believe you have found something great and others must not try to tell you the contrary. When you start liking Ecstasy, it’s too late, you’re sunk.” </i><b>-Pat</b>
