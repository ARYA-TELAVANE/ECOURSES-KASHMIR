        industrial products including paint thinners, degreasers, gasoline, glues, correction fluids and felt-tip marker
        fluids.

          <li>Taking Ecstasy can cause liver failure, as in the case of a 14-year-old girl who died of this, despite an
            attempt by doctors to save her with a liver transplant.</li>
          <li>Ecstasy is sometimes mixed with substances such as rat poison.</li>
          <li>Young people have died from dehydration, exhaustion and heart attack as a result of taking too much
            Ecstasy.</li>
          <li>Ecstasy can cause kidney, liver and brain damage, including long-lasting lesions (injuries) on brain
            tissue.</li>
          <li>Even a small amount of Ecstasy can be toxic enough to poison the nervous system and cause irreparable
            damage.</li>

        <b>SPRAYS</b> such as spray paints, deodorant and hair sprays, vegetable oil sprays for cooking and fabric
        protector sprays.
        <br><br>
        <b>GASES</b> including medical anesthetics (ether, chloroform and nitrous oxide, commonly called “laughing
        gas”), butane lighters, propane tanks, whipped cream dispensers and refrigerants.
        <br><br>
        <b>NITRITES</b>(a chemical compound found in food preservatives, leather cleaner, room deodorizers, etc.) are
        considered a special class of inhalants which act directly on the central nervous system, brain and spinal cord.
        They are used mainly as sexual enhancers and are commonly known as “poppers” or “snappers.”

          was addicted and I had to give him money to get a tube of glue. I needed several tubes of glue daily.”
